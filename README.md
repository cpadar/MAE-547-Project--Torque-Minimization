# MAE-547-Project--Torque-Minimization

## Description
This repository contains the code to minimize torque control effort for a 2-link robot that is moving from one position to another. Optimization of the torque control effort takes place in the MATLAB code. The MuJoCo simulation is intended to provide a visual behind the robot motion. 

## Files Included
- `547_Project.mlx` - MATLAB `.mlx` file for optimization and plotting
- MuJoCo XML and supporting simulation files

## How to Run
1. Open the `.mlx` file in MATLAB.
2. Open the MuJoCo simulation files in MuJoCo.
3. Run the scripts as labeled inside the files.
